# TranslatorAI


Utilized Flask as the web framework to create a Language Translator, where users can input text and receive the translated version of that text based on the language they select.

Microsoft Azure provides a tool called Cognitive Services that allows us to use text translation. I was able to make API calls to specific HTTP endpoints that allowed for any user input to be translated.
